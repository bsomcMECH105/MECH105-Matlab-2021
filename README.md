<h2>Here you will find the algorithms I completed for my MECH105 class, completed in the summer of 2021, at Colorado State University.</h2>
<h3>Homework 2</h3>

The code above presents plots, that show correct labeling, between a time function. It was also necessary to create subplots.

<h3>Homework 3</h3>

For this code it was needed that we solve for volume with given data, such as height, diameter, etc. We had to use the fprintf function to display our answer.

<h3>Homework 5</h3>

In this algorithm I created a n x m matrix with several different values. First, the value in the first row had to be the number of the column. Second, the value in the first column had the be the row number. we then had to create the rest of the elements by adding the element above and to the left of the element. 

<h3>Homework 17</h3>

In this assignment, it was required to develop a function that shows the LU factorization of a square matrix. We were given certain inputs and outputs that we abided by. 

<h3>Homework 22</h3>

In this algorithm, we were able to integrate experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 rule. When there was an odd number of intervals, it used the trapezoidal rule on the last interval and presented a warning stating that the trapezoidal rule was being used. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, there were many obstacles to conquire during the course of this class. It was especially difficult to complete everything during the summer, with all of the work and personal issues I had to deal with. I learned a lot and am overall I am glad that I stuck with it and finished the class. Although it was difficult and sometimes frustrating it all ended up benefiting me for my future.
